# 🛡️ Walkthroughs by Unish Dhungana

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity walkthroughs repository! This is a collection of write-ups and solutions for various penetration testing labs and challenges that I’ve completed as part of my learning journey in the field of cybersecurity.

I’m **Unish Dhungana**, a beginner in the world of ethical hacking and penetration testing. Through this repository, I aim to document my progress and understanding, and hopefully assist other aspiring cybersecurity learners in navigating similar challenges.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
> All walkthroughs in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. The labs and exercises were conducted in **controlled and legal environments**, including TryHackMe, local virtual machines, and sandboxed lab setups. Never attempt to exploit systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
